# AccidentPredictionUsingGRU
The main goal of our project is to evaluate the results of how fast the optimized GRU can predict car crashes in comparison with the previous state-of-the-art models. The reason we opted for this particular goal is to try and predict accidents faster than the already state-of-the-art results. Our motivation is the increasing frequencies of autonomous vehicles on the road and the probability of them replacing human-driven vehicles permanently.
